1) Logs/turtles don't work
Frog should stay with/float on log
Correct typo on_long() to on_log()

2) Dying once kills you completely
Frog should go back to start position
Add self.frog.reset_position() when frog respawns in new_life(self)

3) Game is unplayable on respawn after dying completely


4) Frog can move down offscreen indefinitely
Should stop at bottom
Only move down if frog y < 600

5) Timer is so absolutely massive you can't even tell it's running
TImer should fit in screen
Scale timer - change 20 in ```CANVAS_WIDTH - 100 - 20 * remaining``` to scaled value ```timer_sizing = (CANVAS_WIDTH - 100) / LEVEL_TIME

6) Game continues after time runs out

7) Going into first home kills the frog
